# landify-landing-page
Project for Archi's Academy Frontend Course 

* I used scss in this project because I belive it is improves the code understandability.

* Because of I imported bootstrap i had to name some of variables more unprofessionally. Because most of them have a meaning in bootstrap too.

* I tried to use Jira after our meeting. But it was little complex that's why i couldn't used in this project.

* Project is responsive between 320px and 1920px.
