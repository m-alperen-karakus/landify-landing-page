# landify-landing-page
Project for Archi's Academy Frontend Course 

I used scss in this project because i belive it is improves the code understandability.

Because of I imported bootstrap i had to name some of variables more unprofessionally. Because most of them have a meaning in bootstrap.

I tried to use jira after our meeting.But it was little complex that's why i couldn't used in this project.

roject is responsive between 320px and 1920px
